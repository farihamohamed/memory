## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [X] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [X] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [X] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used this website to find different shades of colors for the start and stop buttons: https://cssgradient.io/shades-of-green/.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I had a some trouble creating the guess function on my own, even after I tried to peak at the solution I realized I didn't understand what was going on. I went back to all the variables and functions I had created and tried to understand what they did. Then I used the flowchart and along with the functions and variables I had already created to create a pseudocode version of the Game function. My code still had errors and was very inefficient, I was using too many else-if statements. I peeked into the code again and cleaned up the code using the solution and now it works.Another challenge I had was understanding the game, when playing it. It takes a while to understand how long to hold the button for. This can be very frustrating because when I was trying to record myself winning the game, I would lose and I wasnâ€™t able to show that in the GIF. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I have so many questions. One of them is, why isn't there an easier way to create the user interface so developers can focus on the logic? For example, when I was making the buttons, it was a very repetitive process that I would like to eliminate or simplify.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would try to add a feature that tells the user how long each button should be held for because it's a very confusing game. I would add numbers on top of the game buttons that specify how many seconds a button should be held for while the computer is playing. While the user is playing, I would change the button that is clicked to zero and show the number going up for every second the button is being held for. ]
